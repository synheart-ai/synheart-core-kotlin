/**
 * Keeps the process alive for the whole sensing session (mobile host guide §6.2).
 *
 * ## Why a host needs this at all
 *
 * The runtime has no internal ticker: [ai.synheart.core.example.sdk.MobileHostRunner]
 * drives `tick_all` once a second, and the engine only closes a window when it
 * is ticked. Android is free to stop scheduling a backgrounded process at any
 * point, so without a foreground service the tick loop simply stops and the
 * session emits nothing from the moment the person leaves the app — silently,
 * with the session still reading as "collecting" when they come back.
 *
 * The guide's note on the field implementation is that a foreground service
 * exists but is started *from the IME*, so it only ever covers typing. This
 * one is bound to the sensing session itself, which is the scope that
 * actually matters.
 *
 * ## `dataSync`, and the Android 15 limit
 *
 * The type is `dataSync` because that is what "keep streaming and processing
 * sensor data" is. On Android 15+ `dataSync` services are capped at roughly six
 * hours per day, after which the system stops them; a host that needs to sense
 * across a full day has to either move to a service type that fits its actual
 * use, or accept the gap and rely on `flush_pending` plus the three snapshots
 * to make the resumption lossless. This example accepts the gap — it is a
 * reference for the call sequence, not a 24-hour collector.
 *
 * ## The notification is not optional
 *
 * A foreground service must post one, and that is the correct trade: a process
 * observing a person's physiology in the background should be visibly doing so.
